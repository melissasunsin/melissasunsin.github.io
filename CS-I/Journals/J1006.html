    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What is Git communicating to you? What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit? Why do you think this is?</h3>
    <p>Git is letting me know information. The git log command gives a log of all that is happening while git commit makes a commit. Since it's best to use each of these when in git they can follow after each other to execute when needed.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status? Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>They are both created and are displayed in git status. Yes they are displayed in the same section because git shows that in the status.</p>
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status? Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed?.</h3>
    <p>They are shown green now because we did the commit command. At first they were red because with did do commit which sets save.</p>

    <h2>Section 4:</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: How many files are listed as having been changed? What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?</h3>
    <p>File1.txt and file2.txt. First it was red now green.</p>

    <h2>Section 5:</h2>
    <h3>Question 1:  What does Git tell you has changed? Why?</h3>
    <p>Since we executed the git commit the changed are now done and nothing else shows.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encounteredn no challenges this assignment.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
