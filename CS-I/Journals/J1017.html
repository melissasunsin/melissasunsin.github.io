    <p>I received assistance from: Ben-Yaakov</p>
    <p>I assisted: No One</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What truth tables do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</h3>
    <p>The truth table I recognize is the Conjunction truth table, in other words the AND gate and the Demultiplexer.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h3>
    <p>The truth table I recognize is the Exclusive OR truth table, in other words the XOR gate.<p/>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?.</h3>
    <p>I notice that the outputs are the same from the top four rows and the a and b inputs are as well.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Why is this true?</h3>
    <p>This is true since they are both use a 1-bit binary integer and a carry.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h3>
    <p>Because it only needs to add two bits.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>Yes the correct output for S will be available.</p>
    <h3>Question 3: Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bits words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted the C15 is high. What can we infer? what is this state commonly called?</h3>
    <p>I can infer that the value is true and it's commonly stated as Set.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that a half-adder is a circuit that adds two bits, a full-adder is a circuit that adds threee bits and a ripple-carry-adder is a circuit that adds an arbitrary of bits.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered no challlenges.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by having a refresher of what we've learned so far of Boolean Algebra and how it is connected.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that computer science is mostly logical and is amazing.</p>
