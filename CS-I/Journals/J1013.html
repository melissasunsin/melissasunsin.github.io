    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction?</h3>
    <p>When the output is true.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n?.</h3>
    <p>Because it depends on how many inputs there are thus, the amount of rows you'll need.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned to understand the boolean algebra to use.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challenges when understanding when something is true or false and how to generally use.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by better images or examples maybe a video would help.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that this is the next step in computer programming.</p>
